Python Pentest Utils

This repository contains several code examples for penetration testing using
Python. These samples are explained and used in the corresponding Pluralsight
course

::

   Web Application Pen Testing with Python

https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/web-application-pentesting-python/table-of-contents

It contains:

+ A ``docker-compose.yml`` file to spin up vulnerable demo web sites
+ Several Python console application files, one for each corresponding module.
  Each module builds on top of the previous one, therefore ``demo_5.py`` is the
  most complete:

  + Analyze HTML page and display framework and version numbers
  + Brute-force file and directory names
  + Find a form in a page, and print form details
  + Print the domain registrant's name and organization
  + Brute-force password logins using a wordlist
  + Perform a port scan against a target

+ Several Burp Python extensions

Demo Web Sites
==============

.. code-block:: console

   docker-compose up --detach

This spins up sites listening on:

+ http://127.0.0.1:3000/
+ http://127.0.0.1:8000/WebGoat
+ http://127.0.0.1:9090/

Python command-line interface script
====================================

demo_2.py

   + Perform a WHOIS lookup
   + Perform an nmap port scan and print out open ports and services

Installation
============

.. code-block:: console

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Burp Python extensions
======================

minimal.py
   A minimal Burp Python extension, to test the configuration

javascript_includes.py
   Extract and print JavaScript include references from HTML files

javascript_includes_scanner.py
   Extract and print JavaScript include references from HTML files, extends the
   passive scanner (audit checks).
